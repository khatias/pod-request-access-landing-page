"This was my first project using JavaScript, and I learned more about the Document Object Model (DOM). I'm excited to keep honing my skills by seamlessly integrating JavaScript and HTML to create more dynamic and interactive web applications. Building on this foundation, I aim to explore deeper into web development and unlock the full potential of these powerful technologies."
